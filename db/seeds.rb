# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# user1 = User.create!(name: 'Vahan')
# user2 = User.create!(name: 'Farouq')
# recipe1 = Recipe.create!(name: 'First recipe', preparation_time: 20, cooking_time: 10, description: 'The specialty of the house', public: true, user: user1)
# recipe2 = Recipe.create!(name: 'Second recipe', preparation_time: 10, cooking_time: 20, description: 'Eastern cuisine', public: true, user: user1)
# recipe3 = Recipe.create!(name: 'Third recipe', preparation_time: 25, cooking_time: 5, description: 'Exotic dish', public: true, user: user2)
